# Changelog

## 3.0.0

*Warning*
This release is a major rewrite that includes changes breaking existing use

- Logic changes
  - Rules with a category of `safe` must have a `from_domain` `meta` value for the category to apply
    - This logic replaces `trusted_domains_yara_safe_required`
    -  `trusted_domain_yara_safe_required`, and `auth_optional` removed from results
  - The `auth_optional`rule `meta` key only applies to that rule 
  - Warnings are located inside a `warnings` list in each match, instead of as a `verdict`
    - A rule category does not apply if one or more warning is raised
      - Possible warnings include
        - `domain-authentication-failed` - Authentication of the message
            From domain failed
          - `from-domain-mismatch` - The message From domain did not exactly
            match the value of the `meta` key `from_domain`
          - `safe-rule-missing-from-domain` - The rule is missing a
            `from_domain` `meta` key that is required for rules with the
            `category` meta key set to `safe`
          - `unexpected-attachment` - An email win an attachment matched a
            rule with the `meta` key `no attachment` or `no_attachments`
            set to `true`
  - Trusted domains are now called implicit safe domains
- API changes
  - `trusted_domains` renamed to `implisit_safe_domains`
  - `trusted_domains_yara_safe_required` parameter removed
  - `include_sld_in_auth_check` parameter removed
  - Returned data structure changed (see docs for details)
- CLI changes
  - `--trusted-domains` renamed to `--implicit-safe-domains`
  - `--trusted-domains-yara` removed
  - `--sld` removed
  - Log output delimiter changed from `:` to `|` to avoid conflicting with JSON

    - `trusted_domain` - A boolean indicating if the authenticated from domain is in the `trusted_domains` list
