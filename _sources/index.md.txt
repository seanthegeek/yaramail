## Installation

```{warning}
It is recommended to use `yaramail` in a different OS than what is targeted by 
the potential malware you are scanning. Consider using `yaramail` inside of a
container or VM for additional security.
```

### System dependencies

Some system dependencies **must** be installed before installing `yaramail`.

#### Debian, Ubuntu, and friends

```
sudo apt install build-essential libpoppler-cpp-dev pkg-config python3-dev libemail-outlook-message-perl
```

#### Fedora, Red Hat, and friends

```
sudo yum install gcc-c++ pkgconfig poppler-cpp-devel python3-devel
```

#### macOS

Install [Homebrew][homebrew], then run the following command in a terminal.

```
brew install pkg-config poppler python
```

#### Windows

1. Install the [Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools][build_tools]
2. Install [Anaconda Distribution][anaconda_distribution]
3. Use Anaconda Navigator to create a new Anaconda Environment
4. Click the play button for the Anaconda Environment
5. Click Open Terminal 
6. Run this command and leave the terminal open:
   ```
   conda install -c conda-forge poppler
   ```
7. Configure your Python IDE/project to use the Anaconda Environment

### Install yaramail

```{note}
The official name for this project, package, and module is `yaramail`. 
Unfortunately, the Python Package Index (PyPI) [did not allow that name to be
used there][pypi-name-issue], so the PyPI project name for `yaramail` is 
`yara-mail`.
```

In a terminal, run

```
pip3 install -U yaramail
```

## Email samples and Outlook clients

### Microsoft Outlook for Windows

If you save an email to a file using Microsoft Outlook on Windows, it will
save the file in a proprietary Microsoft OLE format with a `.msg` extension.
There are tools like `msgconvert` that make an attempt to convert a `.msg`
file to a standard RFC 822 `.eml` file, and `yaramail` will attempt to use
this tool when encountering a `.msg` file if it is installed on the system.
However, anomalies are introduced during conversion that make the results
unsuitable for forensic analysis.

Instead of using `msgconvert`, use one of these other Outlook clients.

```{note}
If a `.msg` file is attached to an email and sent from a Windows Outlook
client, the email will actually be sent as a `.eml` file. So, users can send 
email samples without needing to worry about the file format.
```

### Microsoft Outlook for macOS

Drag the email from the inbox or other folder and drop it on the desktop.
Attached emails can be saved to a file like any other attachment.

### Outlook Web Access (OWA)

1. Create a new email and leave it open a separate window.
2. Drag the email from the inbox or other folder and drop it in the message of the draft.
3. Download the attachment that was created in step 2

Emails that are already attached to an email can be downloaded from OWA like
any other attachment.
